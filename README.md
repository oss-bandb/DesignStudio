# DesignStudio
This repository will contain a set of individual projects to showcase different designs studies/experiments. The goal is to learn to build great UI.

## Non-Goals

* Doesn't provide a guideline of what an architecture should look like. This could be a different showcase project in the future.
* The project is not production ready, the focus was only on the implementation of the design.

## Studies

* Transitions

* Different versions
	* View-based
	* Jetpack Compose (WIP)
